⚠️ yarn eject
Warning: This is a one-way operation! 🚨 Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you need full control over the build configuration, you can eject. This removes the single build dependency and copies all configurations (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.

All commands except eject will still work, but now they will reference the copied scripts, allowing you to customize them. 🎨

However, you don’t have to use eject—the default setup is great for small and medium projects. 🎯
